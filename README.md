# 🏭 Fabric SDK Python 🐍

## 🤔 What's it?

Python library that implements an SDK to operate with the main components 
of the Hyperledger Fabric network. 
**Principal Skills**: `Python` `DSL` `DDD` `Hyperledger Fabric` `Bash` `Docker` 

## 🤓 Motivation 

This project arose because the previous SDK ([this](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-py)) was still neglected by its creator. 
The community has proposed several changes and commented on several problems, 
but these have not been addressed. So we will try to create a new tool based 
on the experience of the community and with the commitment of a continuous maintenance.

## 📚 Documentation
    This tool is still under construction
